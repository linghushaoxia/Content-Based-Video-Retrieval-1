Transcript: Pinterest so we can see the main purpose of raising don't see but that parse receipt right away is that it's not raises that's the main verb of the sentence but interest somebody interest something and then that's something that gets interested is rates

Transcript:  it's fed raises raises by the Fed so the complete different setting for the different interpretation that something is interesting the rates whatever that could mean and it seems unlikely interpretation for people but of course for a parser this is a perfectly reasonable interpretation that we have to learn how to rule out in fact the sentence can get even more difficult this is the actual headline was somewhat longer so we had
