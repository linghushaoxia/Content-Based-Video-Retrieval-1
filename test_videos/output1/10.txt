Transcript: example we might have a source sentence in Chinese and he was at Stanford's phrasal and t-system translating guide into English but empty can also be used to help human translators so here we might have an Arabic text and the human translator translated into English might need some help from the Mt system for example of a collection of possible next words that the empty system can build automatically and help the human translator let's look at the state of the art in language technology like every field and he's divided up into Specialties and subspecialties number of these problems are pretty close to solve so for example spam detection well it's very hard to completely to text spam you her email boxes we don't have 99% spam and that's because spam detection is a relatively easy classification task
