Transcript: a couple of important component tasks part of speech tagging a named entity tagging will talk about those later in the course and those work at pretty high accuracy using to get 97% accuracy and part of speech tagging and we see how that's important for parts and we're making good progress not as commercial not as completely solved but there are systems out there that are that are being used so we talked about sentiment analysis the task of deciding thumbs-up or thumbs-down on the sentence or product
