Transcript: and we add up the deletions of each of the symbols that we delete instead of having just one for insertion we have a cost for each insertion we add them all up and similarly in the recurrence relation we're going to add a special deletion insertion and substitution cost how much does it leak to delete that particular character insert that particular character and then we'll end up with the same termination condition so we'll just add separate look up tables that will tell us what the deletion insertion and substitution cost are for each symbol
