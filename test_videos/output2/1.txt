Transcript:  I think about taking applications in spell correction it's obvious that some letters are more likely to be Miss type than others while in biology because of the constraints of the subject matter some kinds of deletions insertions are more likely than others so for example and spelling there's a confusion Matrix for spelling errors so if you look at this confusion Matrix you can see that he is very likely to be confused with a or o a nice ovalles tend to be confused
