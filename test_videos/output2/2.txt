Transcript:  but also the fact of the keyboard means that you're likely to make errors either using the homologous finger on the other hand or using nearby keystrokes so the constraints of the domain in this case we're talking about the spelling of maybe I can buy a biology I got to make some added to some edits more likely than others

Transcript:  so we got to represent this by modifying the algorithm slightly to add weights so in levenshtein-distance we have the cost of one for insertion one for deletion and two for substitution and waited Minima to since we simply add a special cost of you look up each time so initialization instead of just adding one for each deletion we have the actual cost of each day
